[[about]]
About
~~~~~

You can make C4 Architecture Software System Models with draw.io.

This is a C4 Modelling plugin for
https://github.com/tobiashochguertel/c4-draw.io[draw.io], which provides
C4 Notation Elements in draw.io.

[[quick-start]]
Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Access to link:https://www.draw.io/[].
2.  Save the drawing, or decide later: kbd:[File] -> kbd:[Save] -> kbd:[Option]
3.  Open the plugin dialog: kbd:[Extras] -> kbd:[Plugins]
4.  Open the add plugin dialog with a click: kbd:[Add]
5.  Put in the field kbd:[Enter Value (URL):] the link to the plugin: kbd:[https://tobiashochguertel.github.io/c4-draw.io/c4.js]
6.  Click on kbd:[Apply]
7.  _Reload the page!_ to see the C4 Notation Shapes in the shape panel (_figure 1_).

.figure 1: After the reload, the C4 Notation Shapes are available from the shape panel:

Usage
~~~~~

.figure 2: Quick demonstration of how to use the c4-model plugin:
image:c4-draw.io-preview-demonstration.gif[]

. Drag a C4 notation shape on the diagram paper
. The most C4 notation shapes provide a small gear icon when they are selected. (_figure 3_)
. Edit the Properties of the selected C4 Notation Shape: (_figure 4_)
  .. Click the small gear to open the _properties dialog_ (_figure 3_)
  .. Press the key-stroke kbd:[CMD+M] to open the _properties dialog_ (_figure 3_)
  .. ,or use the menu: kbd:[Edit] -> kbd:[Edit Data (CMD + M)] (_figure 6_)
. Input Cursor / Focus is on the first field of the dialog, and with kbd:[tab] you can jump through the fields and submit (_figure 5_).

[[Good-to-Know-about-the-c4-shapes]]
Good-to-Know about the C4 shapes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- *[red]#Some C4 shapes have issues/limitations which I description in this section:#*

[[c4-relationship-notation-shape]]
C4-Relationship Notation shape:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Has also a properties dialog, but the small gear icon isn't available with this shape. (technical reason, I haven't found a solution, yet.)

- To open for a C4 Relationship shape the Properties Editor:
  -- key-stroke or over menu.

[[c4-person-notation-shape]]
C4-Person Notation shape:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Has also a little technical issue, to open the properties dialog,
  -- gear icon or over menu.

[[directly-modify-the-shape-text]]
Modify the text on the shapes directly rather than using the properties dialog:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

. *is possible,*
. can be handy when you want to (re-)format the text, e.g. bold, italic, font size or when you want to insert a line break within the text/properties.
. *but keep in mind,*
. if you change the text here directly, and as next open the properties dialog of this shape, your changes will get lost because the information on the shape will be reset to the values from the properties dialog.
